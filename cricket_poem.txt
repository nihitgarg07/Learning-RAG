The morning sun breaks on the ground,
A hush of dew, a sacred sound.
The pitch lies ready, calm, serene,
Awaiting battles yet unseen.

The bowler marks his careful stride,
His heartbeat racing deep inside.
A ball in hand, a mind of fire,
Each delivery his one desire.

The batsman waits with guarded stance,
His eyes like steel, no casual glance.
He grips the willow, firm, yet light,
Ready to conquer day or night.

The umpire stands, a figure tall,
A silent judge of every call.
His finger raised, the crowd may roar,
For one decision changes war.

The first ball flies, the crowd holds tight,
The air is thick, the day is bright.
A gentle nick, a quick embrace,
The keeper smiles, it’s just a taste.

The next ball spins, it drifts, it turns,
The batsman studies, waits, and learns.
His bat comes down, a solid thud,
The ball rolls safe, absorbed in mud.

The fielders crouch like tigers near,
Their eyes all sharp, their bodies clear.
One chance, one leap, one sudden dive,
Could turn the game and keep hopes alive.

The boundary rope, a tempting line,
A dream where bat and ball combine.
A crack of wood, the ball takes flight,
It soars away, a dazzling sight.

Four runs declared, the crowd erupts,
The bowler sighs, his spirit disrupts.
But still he charges, fierce and bold,
For cricket’s heart is never cold.

A bouncer climbs, a fiery dart,
It tests the courage, shakes the heart.
The batsman sways, the helmet rings,
Such is the fear fast bowling brings.

The spinner whispers with his hand,
His art like magic, finely planned.
He loops it high, he drifts it wide,
The batsman’s foot cannot decide.

The stumps are shattered, cheers arise,
The fielders run with sparkling eyes.
The bowler smiles, his spell has won,
Another chapter has begun.

The scoreboard ticks, the crowd debates,
Each moment shifts the players’ fates.
One partnership, one sudden fall,
Can write the story of it all.

From dusty lanes where children play,
To stadiums packed on matchday,
Cricket breathes in every street,
With every cheer, with every beat.

It teaches patience, calm, and grace,
It tests endurance in the chase.
It shows how fortune turns its side,
How ego falls, how hearts collide.

From Test match days that stretch so long,
To T20’s fire, both fierce and strong,
The formats change, the love remains,
In sun, in storm, in joys, in pains.

The crowd erupts with chants so loud,
A single game unites a crowd.
From seasoned fans to children small,
The love for cricket binds them all.

Legends rise and fade away,
But cricket’s spirit will always stay.
Each generation finds its flame,
And carves new heroes in the game.

The bat, the ball, the pitch, the song,
A battle fierce, yet never wrong.
For in this sport, both sides unite,
In passion pure, in endless fight.

So let the willow kiss the air,
Let bowlers roar, let fielders dare.
For cricket is not just a game,
It is a fire, it is a flame.

And when the stumps are packed away,
The echoes of the match will stay.
For cricket lives in every heart,
A timeless play, a priceless art.
